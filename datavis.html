<h1>MACS 40700 Data Visualization - Final Project</h1>
<p>For my final project in this course, I created a portfolio to
visualize my MA thesis results. Below, I present the plots I developed
using R Studio, ggplot2, Shiny, and Tableau. Taking this course allowed
me to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gain hands-on experience with data visualization tools.</li>
<li>Understand data visualization principles such as truthfulness,
functionality, beauty, insightfulness and enlightenment.</li>

<h2>Overview of MA thesis project</h2>
<div id="the-moralization-of-self-improvement" class="section level3">
<h3>The Moralization of Self-Improvement</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>Self-improvement is meant to help people grow, being an “essential
human calling” —according to philosopher Rudolf Allers— to achieve our
fullest potential (García-Alandete 2022). However, in today’s culture
the desire to improve has often been portrayed with a moralized tone
that has been related to increased anxiety, pressure, and self-doubt.
While self-improvement has been studied by philosophers and
psychologists since long ago, the way it is experienced today requires a
specific examination in its current context (Coeckelbergh 2022).</p>
<p>The intrinsically positive pursuit of self-improvement and choosing
goals that align with one’s ideals has turned into a source of pressure
and stress when these goals are framed as socially expected moral
obligations. Discussions around self improvement today do not simply
encourage growth but frame certain specific behaviors, that are
sometimes unattainable for many, as moral imperatives. This can lead to
the stigmatization of those who do not conform to what is perceived as
“correct” or “morally right”. Furthermore, the new standards transform
self-care into a source of guilt (Kraaijeveld and Jamrozik 2022).</p>
<p>Previous research has analyzed the use of moralizing language on
social media platforms, as well as users’ experiences when engaging with
content. For instance, one study identified moralization in Instagram
influencers’ discourse around self-improvement, where they promote very
specific behaviors as the correct (Baker 2022). Other studies have shown
that engagement with Instagram trends focused on self-improvement (such
as #fitspiration for physical appearance) can lead to self-obsession,
perfectionism, stress, feelings of inadequacy, and even depression
(Coeckelbergh 2022; Bell, Talbot, and Deighton-Smith 2024). While these
studies have either focused on the moralizing tone or the emotional
response, less is known about the relationship between the two
specifically: how moral language itself contributes to the emotional
experience of self-improvement. Additionally, most of these studies have
been small-scale and have largely concentrated on physical appearance
goals, leaving a gap in understanding how these patterns manifest on a
broader scale or in relation to other areas of self-improvement.</p>
<p>This research aimed to address that gap by analyzing the presence of
moral language in self-improvement discussions at a large scale and
across different sub-topics, as well as evaluating its relationship with
negative emotions. It was found that moralization language does exist
around the desire to self improve and that content with higher
moralization language tends to show more negative emotion. By examining
self-improvement through these lens, this study contributes to a deeper
understanding of how human aspirations for growth are shaped by the
cultural narratives around them that frame them as moral obligations.
Ultimately, this project is only one step of a larger research agenda:
How can the human tendency for self-improvement be experienced in a way
that leads to a truly “good life” rather than unattainable ideals?</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data from the subreddit <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/">r/selfimprovement</a>
was obtained through <a
href="https://academictorrents.com/details/56aa49f9653ba545f48df2e33679f014d2829c10">Academic

<div id="guiding-research-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Guiding Research Questions</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>Three research questions were formulated to guide the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>RQ 1. Is moral language present when talking about
self-improvement?</li>
<li>RQ 2. Are there some specific topics within self-improvement
discussions that tend to be discussed with a higher moral tone?</li>
<li>RQ 3. How does the usage of moral language associate with emotions
in the context of self-improvement?</li>
</ul>
<p>The following visualizations are organized by research question.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<div id="moralization-across-subreddits" class="section level3"
style="text-align: center;">
<h3>1. Moralization across subreddits</h3>
<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/RQ1_17419062265120/Dashboard1?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="600px" height="700px">
</iframe>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>For assessing the presence of moral language in r/selfimprovement, it
was compared with other two subreddits: r/investing and r/homeowners.
Three different ways of measuring moralization were employed:</p>
<p>1- The moral dimension from the <a href="https://www.liwc.app/">LIWC
dictionary</a></p>
<p>2- The <a href="https://www.liwc.app/dictionaries">Moral Foundations
Dictionary 2.0 (MFD)</a> (also using the LIWC software)</p>
<p>3- <a
href="https://github.com/vjosapreniqi/MoralBERT">MoralBERT</a></p>
<p>The goal of the visualization was to present the results from the
three methods collectively, thus strengthening the argument that
self-improvement is a more moralized topic compared to others,
regardless of the method for measuring employed.</p>
<p>Using bar charts is a very simple approach but it makes the
visualization easy to interpret and therefore functional. The scores,
according to each method, are displayed on the axes to allow the user to
visualize the raw score from the measurement tool, staying truthful to
the data.</p>
<p>The Y-axes for the top plot are independent because the MFD scores
tend to be higher, as it incorporates multiple dimensions, while the
MoralBERT is also independent since its results are calculated in a
fundamentally different way from the dictionary-based approaches. An
alternative presentation could be through tables, but this would make it
difficult to grasp the overall picture, given that each measurement
operates on a different scale. The visualization, therefore, adds
insight by combining the findings into a single narrative: that
self-improvement is a more moralized topic. Ultimately, it is
enlightening, as it visually highlights the gap in moralization compared
to other topics, encouraging the reader to reflect on the gap and what
it means.</p>
<p>Both the MFD and the MoralBERT results are based on the <a
href="https://moralfoundations.org/">Moral Foundations Theory</a> that
suggest that morality is composed of different “foundations” or values,
so I chose stacked bar charts to separate between each foundation. By
excluding foundation labels, the emphasis remains on the overall score
and simplicity is preserved. However, interactivity allows users to
hover over each foundation to explore the specific foundations details.
This interactivity is precisely why Tableau was chosen for the
visualization. The color choices for the MFD and MoralBERT results were
carefully selected to represent each foundation’s values while
maintaining accessibility. Both used consistent colors to make it
visually appealing. The chosen colors aim to evoke associations with the
underlying concepts of each foundation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authority (Red): Red is often associated with power, strength, and
leadership.</li>
<li>Care (Light Blue): Light blue is commonly linked to calmness, trust,
and compassion, aligning with the Care foundation’s focus on empathy,
nurturing, and concern for others’ well-being.</li>
<li>Fairness (Yellow): Yellow represents fairness as a value tied to
justice and equality</li>
<li>Loyalty (Orange): Orange conveys warmth, enthusiasm, and connection,
reflecting the sense of loyalty, unity, and community that this
foundation promotes.</li>
<li>Sanctity (Light Purple): Light purple evokes a sense of purity and
spirituality.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LIWC bars are more straightforward, representing a single score
and thus using only one color. Hovering over them reveals the mean score
values for each subreddit. The combination of the military green with
the moral foundation’s colors create harmony for maintaining beauty.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<div id="moralization-within-self-improvement-topics"
class="section level3" style="text-align: center;">
<h3>2. Moralization within self-improvement topics</h3>
</div>
<p><img src="datavis_files/figure-html/topic%20bubbles%20plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><br><br> A bubble chart was used to incorporate three dimensions: the
topics within the r/selfimprovement, the average moral LIWC score for
documents in each topic, and the proportion of each topic within the
corpus. While the proportion isn’t central to the research question,
varying bubble sizes make the visualization more engaging for
beauty.</p>
<p>Placing the moral scores on the horizontal axis frames morality as a
spectrum, allowing readers to easily compare topics in terms of their
average moral tone. Additionally, a reference line was included based on
the LIWC manual’s reported mean for morality scores across Reddit and
other sources. This helps contextualize the results and make it
functional, showing how some topics are particularly more moralized than
others.</p>
<p>Using raw LIWC scores on the x-axis also keeps the plot transparent
and grounded in the data to preserve truthfulness.</p>
<p>Similar to the RQ1 plots, the colors where carefully chosen to be
color-blind friendly and create harmony.</p>
<p>One key takeaway from the visualization is that only the “social
topics” exceed the baseline moral score, an insight facilitated by the
plot. This pattern would be less apparent without sorting and comparing
topics against a reference point. The plot is enlightening as it invites
interpretation, hinting that something unique may be happening with
these socially-oriented discussions, and it encourages the reader to
explore why that might be.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<iframe src="https://natashacarpcast.shinyapps.io/shiny-app/" style="border: 1px solid #AAA; width: 800px; height: 900px">
</iframe>
<p>After visualizing the difference in general moralization among the
topics, this other interactive plot uses a Shiny app to allow the user
to explore the different moral foundations proposed by the <a
href="https://moralfoundations.org/">Moral Foundations Theory</a> and
see how the topics vary in scores among those.</p>
<p>This visualization not only shows the overall moral foundation score
for each topic, but it also includes two additional subplots that break
down each foundation into its virtue and vice components. According to
the <a href="https://moralfoundations.org/">Moral Foundations
Theory</a>, moral language can move in two directions: a virtue tone,
which praises positive behaviors or attitudes (e.g., honest), and a vice
tone, which conveys blame or negativity (e.g., dishonest). Including
both the combined and separated scores allows the reader to gain deeper
insights into how moral language is used within each topic. For
instance, the “Health and Fitness” topic stands out for having the
highest level of sanctity-related language, and notably, this is more
strongly expressed through virtue terms than vice.</p>
<p>The use of an interactive plot helps to present a lot of information
without it being visually overwhelming or repetitive (as it would be if
they were all displayed on the webpage at the same time). Presenting
each foundation separately but within the same interactive space lets
the reader explore the data in an engaging way.</p>
<p>A key design choice was to fix the y-axis across all plots: for
total, virtue, and vice scores across every foundation. By default,
ggplot adjusts the y-axis based on the data range, so differences
between foundations or vice/virtue plots would not be easy to grasp in
such way. Fixing the axis prevents this distortion and makes comparisons
across foundations more accurate and intuitive. For example, the
“fairness” tab displays shorter bars, but this visually shows the
insight that this foundation simply plays a smaller role in the dataset
compared to other foundations like “care.”</p>
<p>While the research question focuses on topics and not foundations,
comparing between foundations adds an important nuance while still
comparing among topics too. It highlights how different values are
distributed across self-improvement discourse and reveals which moral
themes are most prominent within which specific topics. After exploring
the five moral dimensions, it is enlighting to visualize the patterns of
the interaction between topics and foundations, leaving a lot to reflect
on our current understanding of self improvement.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<div id="moralization-and-emotions" class="section level3"
style="text-align: center;">
<h3>3. Moralization and emotions</h3>
<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/RQ3-1/Dashboard3?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="600px" height="750px">
</iframe>
</div>
<p>The goal of this visualization is to highlight differences in
negative emotion, both general and anger-specific, between posts that
are moralized and those that are not. A bar plot was chosen for its
simplicity and clarity, making it easy and functional for readers to
compare values at a first look. The y-axis is clearly labeled, with an
explicit title that accurately reflects the meaning of the values,
preserving transparency and truthfulness in the data presentation.</p>
<p>Colors were selected carefully: blue represents general negativity
and red represents anger. This combination is not only intuitive but
also visually harmonious, enhancing the visual appeal of the plot.</p>
<p>By dividing the corpus into two distinct groups—moral vs. non-moral,
based on the LIWC’s reported mean, the plot offers a straightforward way
to explore the relationship between moral language and negative emotion.
This binary approach simplifies the comparison and avoids complications
from data imbalance, which might otherwise limit the usefulness of
boxplots or scatterplots. In doing so, it reinforces the functionality
of the visualization.</p>
<p>Overall, the plot communicates that posts with higher moral tone tend
to contain more negative emotion, supporting the hypothesis that
moralization may be linked to emotional tension. It offers a compelling
insight that contributes to broader discussions around the emotional
dynamics of moral language.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/RQ3-2/Dashboard2?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="620" height="600">
</iframe>
</div>
<p>This final plot explores the nuances of moral language at the word
level. Built with Tableau, it allows for interactivity: users can hover
over individual data points to see the specific word and the topic it
belongs to, making the experience more engaging and informative. Words
are sized according to their frequency and colored by topic. If a word
appears in multiple topics, it is repeated accordingly, which enables a
more detailed exploration of how moral language shifts across contexts.
For instance, the word “wrong” takes on a noticeably stronger negative
tone in the Mental Health topic than in Confidence &amp; Dating,
highlighting how emotional connotation can vary by theme. Using a text
data visualization revealed two interesting insights that would have
been impossible to detect without a plot: As words become more negative
in emotional tone, they also tend to become more positive, suggesting
that self-improvement may often carry a dual emotional charge, capturing
both the uplifting and challenging aspects of personal growth. Words
cluster spatially by topic across the emotional axes, indicating that
topic influences the emotional tone of moral language.</p>
<p>Although the plot includes a large number of words, making it
difficult to interpret every one individually, these broader patterns
offer meaningful insights. They add depth to our understanding of how
morality is expressed across different areas of self-improvement,
inviting further reflection on the emotional complexity of moralized
discourse.</p>
