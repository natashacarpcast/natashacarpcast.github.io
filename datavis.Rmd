# MACS 40700 Data Visualization - Final Project

For my final project in this course, I created a portfolio to visualize my 
MA thesis results. Below, I present the plots I developed using R Studio, 
ggplot2, Shiny, and Tableau. Taking this course allowed me to:

1) Gain hands-on experience with data visualization tools.
2) Understand data visualization principles such as truthfulness, functionality,
beauty, insightfulness and enlightenment.

Accompanying the plots, you can also look at the rationale of my design choices and
intended takeaways.
